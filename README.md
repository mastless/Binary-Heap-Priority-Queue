# Binary-Heap-Priority-Queue
Developed a Binary Heap Priority Queue using Java. 

All code was abstracted based on a file provided the professor named PriorityQueue<E> with the objects entering having the access of Generics
so that <E> can be any objects long as the file implementing is holding the Object type.
